                <p>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for state management and routing. Redux and React Router are respective examples of such libraries.</p>
          <p>React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
            Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.          </p>
